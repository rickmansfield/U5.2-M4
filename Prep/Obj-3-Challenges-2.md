## Instructions 
In your own words, write out the three rules for recursion and how you can identify when a problem is amenable to using a recursive method.

## Rules & Amenability
1. Base Case (Can Compute nth Term)
2. Decrementable (List first or last n terms
3. Employes HOF (Calls the main function again instide itself. Generates all permutations as a result))
